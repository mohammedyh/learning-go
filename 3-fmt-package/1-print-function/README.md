# The `Print` Function

`fmt.Println()` puts a spaces between all arguments and appends an ending newline.

`fmt.Print()` only adds spaces between operands when neither is a string and doesn't add an ending newline. These need to be added manually.

Both functions use the default formatting for their operands / arguments
