# Logical Operators

Logical operators allow you to check multiple conditions at a time.

Go has the below logical operators:

| Operator | Meaning |
| :------- | :------ |
| &&       | And     |
| \|\|     | Or      |
| !        | Not     |

`&&` - both conditions must be true for the code block to execute
`||` - one condition must be true for the code block to execute
`!` - negates a condition, and must evaluate to true for the code block to execute
