# Scoped Short Declaration Statement

We can also include a short variable declaration before we provide a condition in either `if` or `switch` statements.

The variable declaration is separated from the condition using a semi-colon.

One thing to keep in mind when using the short variable declaration in if or switch statements is that the declared variable is scoped to the statement blocks. Having the variable scoped to the `if` `else if` `else` statement or `switch` statement means that variable is only accessible within the blocks of those statements.
