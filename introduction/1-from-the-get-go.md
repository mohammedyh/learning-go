# From the Get Go

Go (also, but less commonly known as Golang) is a programming language developed by Google for in-house software development, to make their software easier to write, maintain and build.

Go has become very popular, often used for writing APIs and DevOps tools. Go sits in the middle between low-level languages and high-level languages, offering the advantages of both.

Here are a few facts about Go:

- Uses a similar syntax to many languages, including ‘C’.
- Produces code that runs fast and uses very little memory.
- Runs across many platforms.
- Provides simple syntax for multi-threaded programs.
- Provides some object-oriented features.
- Has garbage collection.

Go can be installed in a few ways. It can be installed using Homebrew (`brew install go`) so Go can easily be updated using the `brew update` command.

New versions of Go can be installed using the builtin `go install` command. Example: `go install golang.org/dl/go1.22.3@latest`, and run `go1.22.3 download` to download the new source code files.

PS: The [Go Gopher](https://go.dev/blog/gopher) is the mascot for the Go programming language.
