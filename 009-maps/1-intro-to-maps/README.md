# Introduction to Maps

Think of a list of contacts on a phone. We can search by name to find the associated phone number. In programming, we often need to connect one data piece with another. This association is what maps are perfect for.

A map is an unordered collection of **keys** and **values**. Below is an example of connecting a key of type `string` with a value of type `int`:

| Key    | Value      |
| :----- | :--------- |
| Joe    | 2126778723 |
| Angela | 4089978763 |
| Shawn  | 3143776876 |
| Terell | 5026754531 |

We can access map values by looking them up with a key. Unlike an array, map values are not accessed by indices. Maps allow for very fast lookups by organizing the values for retrieval.

We use maps for tasks such as:

- Counting the number of times unique names appear in a list.
- Mapping simple identifiers, such as an employee id, to related values.
- Anytime we need to associate any piece of data with another.
