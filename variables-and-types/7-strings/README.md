# Strings

We’ve talked about numeric types so far, but Go offers a other built-in types. A string is Go’s type for storing and processing text. In a general programming sense, “string” is a term for text of any length, and the name is chosen to evoke a sequence of data.

Text must be surrounded using double-quotation marks. The single-quote `'` has a special meaning and isn’t used to define strings. If you use single quotes to surround a string the Go compiler will raise an error.

Strings can be concatenated using the `+` operator.
