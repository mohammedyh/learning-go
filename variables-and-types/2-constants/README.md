# Constants

In addition to literal (unnamed) values, there are also named values. One example of named values are constants, which cannot be updated while the program is running. Another example of named values are variables. Unlike constants, we _can_ update a variable's value.

We use the `const` keyword to create a constant. We immediately assign a value to it using a literal. In the rest of the program, we can use the constantâ€™s name instead of the literal value.
