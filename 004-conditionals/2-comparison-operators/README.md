# Comparison Operators

Here are two commonly used comparison operators:

| Operator | Meaning         |
| :------- | :-------------- |
| ==       | Is equal to     |
| !=       | Is NOT equal to |

There is nothing much to note about the "equal to" and "not equal to" operators. If comparing to JavaScript, Go uses two equal signs for "equal to" and one equal and exclaimation mark for "not equal to". Go doesn't perform type coercion like JavaScript, because it requires both operands be of the same type.

Below are the rest of Go's comparison operators:

| Operator | Meaning                  |
| :------- | :----------------------- |
| <        | Less than                |
| >        | Greater than             |
| <=       | Less than or equal to    |
| >=       | Greater than or equal to |
