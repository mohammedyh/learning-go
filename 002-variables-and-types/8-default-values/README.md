# Default Values

Before a variable is assigned a value, they hold a value. Go’s designers attempted to make these “sensible defaults” that we can anticipate based on the variable’s types.

- All numeric variables (ints and floats) have a default value of 0
- Strings have a default value of "" - empty string
- Booleans have a default value of false.
