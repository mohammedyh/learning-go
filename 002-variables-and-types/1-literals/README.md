# Literals

In Go, values can be many things. To name a few, values can be numbers, like 109, or text wrapped in quotes, like "Hello world". These values can be written into code as is, and are called literals.

We can perform arithmetic in Go with literals using the following operators:

- \+ to add
- \- to subtract
- \* to multiply
- / to divide
- % to take the remainder (the modulus operator) between two numbers.

```go
fmt.Println(20 * 3) // Prints: 60
fmt.Println(55.21 / 5) // Prints: 11.042
fmt.Println(9 % 2) // Prints: 1
```

For brevity the `import`, `package` and `func` declarations are omitted.
