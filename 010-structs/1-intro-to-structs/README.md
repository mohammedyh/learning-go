# Introduction

We often have many variables related to each other, but managing using them all together can be a headache. Go provides us with a way to group several variables into one custom data type. These types make the code cleaner, more intuitive, and less error-prone.

In Go, grouping together related variables is done using a `struct`, which is a user-defined (custom) type that combines several fields of different data types, but related, forming a collection.

To use these structs, we need to define what is inside of it.
