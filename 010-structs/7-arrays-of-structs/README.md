# Arrays of Structs

When dealing with many structs of the same type we can use them in an array together. Letâ€™s say we want to create an array of the following points: `{1, 1} {7, 27} {12, 7} {9, 25}`.

We can create an array of `Point` structs like so:

```go
type Point struct {
  x int
  y int
}

points := []Point{{1, 1}, {7, 27}, {12, 7}, {9, 25}}
```

If the points have names, we can also create the array like this:

```go
a = {1, 1}
b = {7, 27}
c = {12, 7}
d = {9, 25}

points := []Point{a, b, c, d}
```

We can access the contents of this array like we would for an ordinary array. We can also access and modify the fields of each of the array elements.

```go
points := []Point{{1, 1}, {7, 27}, {12, 7}, {9, 25}}

fmt.Println(points[0])
// Output: {1, 1}

points := []Point{{1, 1}, {7, 27}, {12, 7}, {9, 25}}

points[1].x = 8
points[1].y = 16

fmt.Println(points[1])
// Output: {8, 16}
```

Arrays of structs allow us access many instances of our structs together in our programs!
