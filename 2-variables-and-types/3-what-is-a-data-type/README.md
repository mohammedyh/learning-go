# What is a Data Type?

Programming languages need to process and organize data. That data is stored as binary in the memory of your computer. Data types are designations by a programming language about what information is being stored. Go comes with a number of data types built into the programming language. It’s also possible to create your own types that combine these basic types into something more complex.

Go has three basic categories for numbers:

- Integers, or `int`s, are whole numbers. You would use an `int` to count the number of books on a shelf, the number of products in a warehouse, the number of people on a website etc.
- Floating-point numbers, or `float`s, can include fractional data. You would use a `float` to store distances, percentages, and other quantities that required division or precision.
- Complex numbers, `complex`, are pairs of floating-point numbers where the second part of the pair is marked with the “imaginary” unit _i_. Complex numbers are particularly useful when reasoning in 2-dimensional space and have other utilizations that make them relevant for involved calculations.
