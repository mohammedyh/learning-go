# Modifying Array Values

The syntax for modifying array values is quite simple

```go
array[index] = value
```

Where index is any valid index in the array, value is any expression we want. Letâ€™s say we had an array, and we decide we want the third element to now be 33.

```go
myArray := [4]int{10, 24, 5, 47}
myArray[2] = 33
```

The content of the array would now be `{10, 24, 33, 47}`

We can use this syntax to modify any valid index, between `0` and the length of the array.
